# AR-Business-Card

AR Business Card explains the concept of Virtual Button in Vuforia and the six important factors that should be considered while working with Virtual Button.  

First I create a simple Virtual Button app called AugmentedRealityVirtualButton in which I perform the the important function & interface that are required for working with Virtual Button.  

After the ARVirtualButton app I create then create and ARBusinessCard. In the ARBusinessCard app i first place multiple virtual buttons on top of an Image Target. Next I play video file inside Unity, After this i write a C# script to play a particular video when the virtual button for a particular video is pressed
